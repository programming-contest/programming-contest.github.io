We organize meetups to presente characteristics of a certain language, or particularities of an algorithm. 
Our 2 favorite languages are Java and Python, even if C/C++, C#, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Bash ... are cool languages.

If you want to resolve algorithmic issues, to practice interview exercices, to entertain online coding challenges, 
or simply to discover algorithmic and programming, you are welcome. 

We are an non-profit organisation, everyone is volunteer.
